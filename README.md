Hileco Schema Forms : HSF
=========================

GENERATES FORMS USING SCHEMAS, ON FORM SUBMIT JSON IS POSTED

Testing
-------
For testing we are using Jasmine, see [SpecRunner.html](./SpecRunner.html)

Schema
------
The schema format is very simple, much like the JSON schema draft, however not equal, the schema
used here is more readable and easier to maintain, and most important of all; easier to make forms with.

For now, just look in the spec, this readme must be updated later, as the schema format is under development.
